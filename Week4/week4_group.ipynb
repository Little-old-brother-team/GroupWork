    "3. Solve Nonlinear Equation for a Vibrating Beam  \n",
    "    An important engineering problem that arises in a lot of applications is the vibrations of a clamped beam where the other end is free. This problem can be analyzed analytically, but the calculations boil down to solving the following nonlinear algebraic equation:  \n",
    "    $$  \n",

    "where $\\rho$ is the density of the beam, $A$ is the area of the cross section, $E$ is Young’s modulus, and $I$ is the moment of the inertia of the cross section. The most important parameter of interest is $\\omega$, which is the frequency of the beam. We want to compute the frequencies of a vibrating steel beam with a rectangular cross section having width $b = 25$ mm and height $h = 8$ mm. The density of steel is 7850 kg/m$^3$, and $E = 2 × 10^{11}$ Pa. The moment of inertia of a rectangular cross section is $I =bh^3/12$.  \n",
